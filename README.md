# Time Series Prediction with SimpleRNN

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict future values of a time series. The project uses a synthetically generated sine wave with added noise to demonstrate how RNNs can learn sequential patterns.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform time-series forecasting. It covers:
- Generating a synthetic sine wave dataset with Gaussian noise.
- Data preprocessing using the **Sliding Window** technique.
- Building a deep learning model with **SimpleRNN** layers using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Visualizing the model's performance by comparing predicted values against actual data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (Deep Learning Framework)
- **NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
